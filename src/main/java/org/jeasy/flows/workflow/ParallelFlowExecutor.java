     * TODO Making the executor configurable requires to answer the following questions first:
     *
     * 1. If the user provides a custom executor, when should it be shutdown? -> Could be documented so the user shuts it down himself
     * 2. If the user provides a custom executor which is shared by multiple parallel flow, shutting it down here (as currently done) may impact other flows
     * 3. If it is decided to shut down the executor at the end of the parallel flow, the parallel flow could not be re-run (in a repeat flow for example) since the executor will be in an illegal state
